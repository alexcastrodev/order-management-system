# Summary

As Spring Boot is not my day a day work, the decision of folder and files structure will be decided by the docs.

https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/using/structuring-your-code.html#using.structuring-your-code.locating-the-main-class

as the project grows, I can change and docs will be updated.
